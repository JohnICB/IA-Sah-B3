                    <p class="about-description">Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered gameboard with 64 squares
                        arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid. Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights,
                        two bishops, and eight pawns. Each of the six piece types moves differently, with the most powerful
                        being the queen and the least powerful the pawn. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king
                        by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-description"> To this end, a player's pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces, while supporting
                        each other. During the game, play typically involves making exchanges of one piece for an opponent's
                        similar piece, but also finding and engineering opportunities to trade one piece for two, or to get
                        a better position. In addition to checkmate, a player wins the game if the opponent resigns, or (in
                        a timed game) runs out of time.

                <p class="description-tutorial2">Each piece has its own way of moving. In the diagrams, the dots mark the squares to which the piece can move
                    if there are no intervening piece(s) of either color (except the knight, which leaps over any intervening
                    pieces):
                    <br>
                    <br> ~The
                    <b>king</b> moves one square in any direction. The king also has a special move called castling that involves
                    also moving a rook.
                    <br> ~The
                    <b>rook</b> can move any number of squares along a rank or file, but cannot leap over other pieces. Along
                    with the king, a rook is involved during the king's castling move.
                    <br> ~The
                    <b>bishop</b> can move any number of squares diagonally, but cannot leap over other pieces.
                    <br> ~The
                    <b>queen</b> combines the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank, file,
                    or diagonal, but cannot leap over other pieces.
                    <br> ~The
                    <b>knight</b> moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. (Thus
                    the move forms an "L"-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally
                    and one square vertically.) The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.
                    <br> ~The
                    <b>pawn</b> can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on
                    its first move it can advance two squares along the same file, provided both squares are unoccupied (black
                    dots in the diagram); or the pawn can capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of
                    it on an adjacent file, by moving to that square (black "x"s). A pawn has two special moves: the en passant
                    capture and promotion.</p>
